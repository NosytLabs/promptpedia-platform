First Principles

Reduce the problem to fundamentals and rebuild solution logic without unwarranted assumptions.

The problem I’m working on is

\[state the problem in one or two sentences\]

Using this, break it down into first principles by

Stripping away assumptions and restating the problem in its most basic terms

Identifying the fundamental truths or constraints that are undeniably valid

Rebuilding the logic step by step into a solution approach that is free from unproven assumptions

Highlighting how this new framing changes or challenges my original perspective

Keep the explanation clear, logical, and structured so I can see both the raw fundamentals and the rebuilt solution logic.
